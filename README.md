# CoWin Vaccine Slot Availability Checker

A small real-time system which keeps updating for available vaccinations slots given the choices of district (multiple districts supported) and age selected. The slots information gets auto-refreshed every 10-15 seconds so you don't have to move away or refresh the page yourself.   

- Shows slots categorised by vaccine type
- Heroku compatible
- Uses CoWin Open APIs
- Only shows available slots so you don't get messy UI. Clean UI.

Remember you'd have to still go to the CoWin website to actually book a slot. The website just takes the pain of constantly refreshing the actual website to check for availability. Also you don't need to squint your eyes to find a 18+ slot for yourself in there.
